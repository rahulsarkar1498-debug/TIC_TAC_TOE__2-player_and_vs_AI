# TIC_TAC_TOE__2-player_and_vs_AI
This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to provide two interactive gaming modes:  Human vs. Human – Two players can play against each other locally.  Human vs. AI – A single-player mode where the user competes against an AI opponent.
The AI is implemented using the Minimax algorithm, a classic decision-making algorithm in game theory. It ensures the AI always makes the best possible move, making it a challenging opponent for the player.
